    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // Definitely 9, because this got me more interested in Java itself, I regarded it as being obsolete etc due to Java browser plugins, but now I'm cosindering using it for a personal project

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // The format of the lectures: the humour was great and made the atmosphere brighter
    // The grading, as everything is project based theres no stress about passing an exam etc

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // The time: I can't function at 8 AM.
