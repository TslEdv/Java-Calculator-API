    // todo
    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // 7

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I liked the funny references during the lectures, java as a language is pretty interesting. I also enjoyed the project works because I could do it with friends, but
    // this could be not so great for people who do not have great contacts in the class.

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // During part of course when we were still learning java and not doing the project, I did not really know what to do because I was not familiar with java,
    // so I just had to wait and see the solutions to the lessons but I started understanding java and it's logic when we started the projects.

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // The gitgame was a nice touch and also helped understand a bit more.
