    //  The course is coming to an end and I would like you to tell me how did it go

    //todo A
    // On the scale 1 to 10 how useless or useful this course was with 1 being very useless and 10 being very useful?
    // Id give it 7, prerecorded lectures were interest to follow although id prefer more to have exercise as a whole not divided by to dos.

    //todo B
    // Write some things you liked? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I liked that we had exercises explained trough while also solved them trough.
    //

    //todo C
    // Write some things you didn't like? At least 1, but you can write more.
    // I was struggling to understand all the logic, and there wasn't that much exercises to practise with and slides could have been a bit more detailed, for example with strema.
    //

    //todo D
    // Anything else to add? Comments? What to do differently next year? (optional)
    // Git game helped a lot, I understood things after it.
